# BusMall User Stories

## As the Focus Group Participant: 

1. As a user, I want an easy and clear way to see what my choices are so then the BusMall can tailor their products to my likes and interests. 

2. As the user, I want to see what the results of the survey so that I can verify what was chosen. 

3. I want the app to be enjoyable to use. Meaning, I want to know where I need to click and the instructions to be very clear so I'm not wondering what I need to do. 

4. I want to know that my selections are actually impacting the selection of products for BusMall. 

## As the Marketing Research Team: 

1. As a memeber of the research team, I want to see very clearly what images the focus team has clicked on and what percentage the images were clicked on. 

2. I don't want the users to see their results until after the answer 25 times so that their answers are not tainted. 

3. I want to take in this user input so that BusMall features only the items in its catalog that are the most likely to sell.

4. We also want to use the information from this so our marketing content can be cost effective and tailored to our audience. 

## As the Developer: 

1. I want right dry code that is easy to understand and performs the functions that BusMall is asking for. 

2. I want the survey to quit after 25 votes and then show the results and not before then. 

3. I want to display three images at a time so the user can choose their preferences and not repeat those images back-to-back. 

4. I want to create an app that is appealing to eye and fun for the Focus Group Participants to participate in.
