#BusMall

This is a project featuring a survey that is done by clicking images. Once you have clicked on the images you prefer for 25 times the data is then collected and displayed via charts in the 'Survey Results' section. 

This project also utilizes Local Storage. So you can take a survey, close your browser and walk away, and it will still remember the results of your latest survey and will continue to add the results of each survey together. 

There is a top product section which is determined by the number of times you voted on an image. The Top 3 Most Popular images will display in the results section. 

You can check out the project's deployment here: [https://justeban.github.io/BusMall/].
